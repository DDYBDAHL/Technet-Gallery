# Scripts repository
New and all scripts from Technet Gallery moved to here. 

**What am I doing?**

*	I am publishing my previous Microsfot Technet Gallery scripts files on GitHub to keep it live on tech community.

*	This GitHub repository helps me to organize some scripts and skills that I've developped throughout my learning, labs and projects challenges.

*	Within this repository there will be lab guides in PDF format, PowerShell scripts, VBS scripts and customization files such as JSON files, XML files and so on and so forth.

Please use the Issues tab to provide feedback. I will periodically create new files to incorporate the changes and work if you as you'd like to.

I hope using this GitHub repository brings a sense of collaboration to the labs and improves the overall quality of your skills development experience.
