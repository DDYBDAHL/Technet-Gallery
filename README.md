# Scripts repository
New and all scripts from Technet Gallery moved to here. 

**What am I doing?**

*	I am publishing my previous Microsfot Technet Gallery scripts files on GitHub to keep it live on tech community.

*	This GitHub repository helps me to organize some scripts and skills that I've developped throughout my learning, labs and projects challenges.

*	Within this repository there will be lab guides in PDF format, PowerShell scripts, VBS scripts and customization files such as JSON files, XML files and so on and so forth.
